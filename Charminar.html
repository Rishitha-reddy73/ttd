      <h1 class="heading">Charminar</h1>
      <p class="para">
        Undeniably the most prominent landmark of Hyderabad, Charminar has rightly been called as 'Arc de Triomphe of the East'. It is also called the 'Mosque of the four minarets'. Not visiting this magnificent architecture while on a Hyderabad tour is nothing less than a sacrilege, especially if you are a travel enthusiast. Not only Hyderabad, Charminar has become an iconic monument for the entire India. An Urdu word, Charminar, means four turrets (char- four, minar-turret).

      <p class="para">
        As suggested by its name, Charminar does have four exquisitely carved pillars, one of each side. This impressive structure stands calmly amid the hustle bustle of Laad Bazaar of the Old city. Maintained by the Archeological Survey of India, Charminar is a representation of the historical background of the city, its glamour, glory and cultural richness. Since its construction in 1591 by Mohammed Quli Qutub Shah of Shah Dynasty, Charminar has been captivating every visitor, with its architectural beauty as well as religious and historical significance.

      <p class="para">
        Charminar was built by Sultan Mohammed Quli Qutb Shah in 1591. It is said that this square shaped structure with four pillars and intricate carvings was built in honour of his wife, Bhagmati. However, the actual reason behind building Charminar is still not clear.

      <p class="para">
        As per a popular belief, Charminar was built to acknowledge the elimination of the plague which had affected the entire city immensely during that era. It is believed that the Sultan had prayed for the end of this plague with which his people were suffering. Hence, as the plague ended, he built the charminar as a tribute to Allah. The four pillars are also said to be dedicated to the first four caliphs of Islam.

    <p class="para">
        An Iranian architect Mir Momin Astrawadi, who had settled in Hyderabad, designed Charminar. It presents an imposing structure which has clearly withstood the test of time. It is a square shaped monument with four pillars, one on each side. The architectural design of Charminar is inspired from the Shia "tazias". These Tazias were built in the memory of Hussain, who was the son in law of Prophet Muhhamed and had lost his life in the battle of Karbala.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
        The square shape of the monument measures 20 meters on each side. Each side of the monument is 11 meter wide and overlooks the four prominent thoroughfares. Charminar has been built with granite and lime mortar.
