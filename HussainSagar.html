      <h1 class="heading">Hussain Sagar</h1>
      <p class="para">Large manmade lakes are a testimony to the efforts of our rulers in historical times. Take a stroll across the lake's boulevards on a pleasant evening and it is when you notice the cool breeze smoothly caressing your senses welcoming you to this place. The tank bund is dotted with elegant statues of eminent historic personalities such as Nannayya, Tikkana, Molla, Sri Sri, Jashua, Annamayya, Tyagayya, Vemana Errana, Rudramma, and Pingali Venkaiah greeting you warmly. The Tank Bund, which is the dam/embankment to the Hussain Sagar, serves as the link between the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad. It was built by Hazrat Hussain Shah, and today it is a major tourist attraction. A monolithic statue of the Buddha installed with pain staking efforts in the heart of this lake is an added charm. The lake was excavated in the year1562 A.D. by Hussain Shah Wali during the reign of Ibrahim Quli Qutb Shah, the promenade of which is now a busy thoroughfare. Boating and water sports are a regular feature in the Hussain Sagar Lake. It is a large manmade lake of Hyderabad and was constructed on a small tributary of the Musi River. It is a sprawling lake that holds water in all seasons. The Department of culture organizes cultural programmes here regularly.</p>
