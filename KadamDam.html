      <h1 class="heading">Kadam Dam</h1>
      <p class="para">Rivers are the lifelines of human civilization and so are the dams built across them for irrigation and hydel power that serves as places of interest too. One such notable attraction in Adilabad distracts is Kadam dam. It is located across Kadam River, a tributary of Godavari River which enters Telangana from Maharashtra. The dam is located at the confluence of Kadam River into Godavari.</p>
      <p class="para">
        The dam’s main purpose is to irrigate close to 25000 hectares in Adilabad district. Also known as the Godavari North Canal project, the structure was built between 1949 and 1965. The dam’s location in the midst of scenic hillocks and greenery makes it an ideal destination for nature lovers. Kadam Dam is also accessible easily to tourists due to its proximity to the Secunderabad-Manmad railway line. According to history, the dam is named after a rushi by the name Kandava who had performed great yagnas here, while it was officially renamed by the government as Kadam Narayana Reddy Project (KNRP) as a tribute to a popular leader of this region. The project serves many mandals through both left and right canals. The left canal serves villages like Pedda bellal, Chinna bellal, Chityal, Kondukur, Kannapur, Moriigudem, Patha kondukur, Uppari gudem, Chinna camp, Perka palli, and other villages of Kadem mandal. The right canal serves Jannaram, Dandepally, Tallapallli, Myadarpet, and Luxettipet among others.
      </p>
    <p class="para">
        Currently the dam has a capacity to irrigate 68000 hectares of ayacut. The project has an adjacent beautiful park where tourists can have a real fun moment. The gushing waters from the flood gates during monsoon season is an awe-inspiring moment for tourists. The dam is located 40 Km from Nirmal, which is accessible by road from Hyderabad and Adilabad. Adilabad is the nearest railway station.
