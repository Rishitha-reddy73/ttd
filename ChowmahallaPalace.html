        Built in the 18th century, almost 200 years ago, the Chowmahalla Palace is one of the popular sightseeing places in Hyderabad. The literal meaning of this place is “Four Palaces” with “Chow” means four in Urdu and “Mahalat” which is the plural of “Mahalel” meaning palaces. Chowmahalla palace is said to resemble Shah Palace of Tehran in Iran.

      <p class="para">
        The construction of Chowmahalla Palace was mainly completed between 1857 to 1869 during the rule of fifth Nizam, Afzar-ud-Daulah, Asaf Jav V. However, its building is mostly credited to Nizam Salabat Jang in 1790. The Palace originally covered 45 acres which extended from the Laad Bazaar on the north to the Aspan Chowk Road on the south. Now, the total remained area of the palace is close to 12 acres.

        The Chowmahalla Palace is consisted of two courtyards which are divided into the northern courtyard and the southern courtyard. The southern courtyard of the palace has four palaces which are namely Afzal Mahal, Tahniyat Mahal, Mahtab Mahal, and Aftab Mahal. The Aftab Mahal is a two storied building and is the biggest of all the four. The northern courtyard which has been open to public, houses Bara Imam, a long corridor with many rooms on the eastern side, which was once the administrative wing. Another captivating feature of this courtyard is the Shishe-Alat. This was used to receive guests and public figures.

At the Council Hall, various manuscripts and rare books which were personal collections of the Nizam have been kept.
