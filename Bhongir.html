      <h1 class="heading">Bhongir Fort</h1>
      <p class="para">The Bhuvanagiri Fort stands as a testimony to the history of Telangana state, which is the epitome of many battles. This magnificent fort, which dates back nearly 3000 years, is home to many astonishing structures. Telangana is a separate state after the partition of Andhra Pradesh. Tourists visiting Telangana will be interested in visiting places like Hussain Sagar and Birla Mandir in Hyderabad as well as historical sites like Charminar and Golconda Fort. Not just in the city of Hyderabad, but in many parts of Telangana. Bhubanagiri Fort is one of the most prominent places in the Yadadri Bhuvanagiri district.</p>
      <p class="para">
        In folklore, there are many stories about the cities of Bhuvanagiri Durgam and Bhuvanagiri. A king of the Chalukya dynasty, Rajayagiri, was looking for a fort on the Mallanna Gutta. Impressed by the beauty of the mountain, King Rajagiri built a khilla at the fort. When the King Inamuliku gave Bonaiyah, who had shown such a wonderful place, he gently rejected them and requested that his name and the name of his wife Giramma be built together. Legend has it that the city that the king built on their names is today cultured in Bhuvanagiri. However, there is no historical basis for this folklore.

    <p class="para">
        Historians say that Bhuvanagiri Durgam was built more than 3 thousand years ago, and that Bhuvanagiri region was ruled by everyone who ruled Telangana. However, archaeologists say that there are human settlements in the area before the Bhuvanagiri Fort. Here the medieval era burrows, arrows, stone axes, swords and tombs were uncovered. Traces of medieval human habitation, as well as human settlements of the Neolithic age, were discovered

    <p class="para">
        Bhuvanagiri Fort was a long time ruled by Qutub Shahi. Later, when the Mughals invaded Golconda in 1687, they came to power. Sarvai Pandu who was born in Telangana to a common Kalu Geetha family won the Orugal in 1708 and later took over Bhuvanagiri. Prior to his conquest of Golconda he had hid his vast treasures here at the Kalika Mata temple in the interior of the hill. There are many caves and tunnels that have not yet been discovered in the hill. Historians claim that the coins of the Vishnu Kundi period were found here.
