        The major attraction for visitors within the zoo is the Lion Safari. A van fenced with iron will take you through the gates of the safari. Here only one gate opens at a time and you will find yourself surrounded by an entirely different world of wild animals like lions, tigers, rhinos, panthers, wild oxen, etc. that roam freely in the wilderness of a jungle-like environment. Visitors can make their trip more interesting by visiting the pre-historic dinosaur park, a nocturnal zoo, a natural history museum, a mini-train, several parks, and animal rides, which makes it an ideal spot for picnic. The nocturnal animals and the reptiles constitute another interesting and exciting part of the whole experience.
