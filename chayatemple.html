      <p class="para">
        Chaya Someswara Temple, also known as the Chaya Someshvara Swamy Alayam or the Saila-Somesvara temple, is a Saivite Hindu temple located in Panagal, Nalgonda district of Telangana, India. It was built around the mid 11th-century during the rule of the Kunduru Chodas (a branch of Tamil Cholas), supported and embellished further by later Hindu dynasties of Telangana. Some date it to late 11th to early 12th-century.

      <p class="para">
        The temple, now partially restored, was in ruins in mid 20th-century. It has three garbhagriya (sanctums), a form of temple architecture that is called Trikutalayam (three-shrine complex). The sanctums are dedicated to Shiva, Vishnu and Surya. The three shrines share a common hall (mandapam) with intricately carved pillars in the Telingana style. These carvings depicts scenes from the Mahabharata, Ramayana and Puranas. The temple is a popular pilgrimage site during Maha Sivaratri. The temple has three entrances.

      <p class="para">
        The temple is in close proximity to <a href="PachalaSomeswaraTemple.html">Pachala Someswara temple</a>, another Saivite shrine in Panagal. The pillars in the Ardhamandapa and open spaces near the central Shiva shrine were designed and placed by the temple architect in such a way as to cast a unified shadow (Chaya in Telugu) constantly on the lingam all through the day, irrespective of the position of the sun. This gave its name to the temple - Chaya Someswara Swamy temple
